## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze hospital datasets to uncover insights related to:
-Patient admissions & discharge trends
-Department-wise performance
-Doctor workload & efficiency
-Billing and revenue analytics
-Appointment patterns
-Emergency vs OPD flow

This project showcases my ability to work with large datasets, perform ETL pipelines, and build interactive dashboards for business decision-making.

## Project Workflow

1️⃣ Data Collection & Cleaning (Excel)

-Handled missing values
-Standardized formats (dates, ID, billing codes)
-Cleaned duplicates
-Created helper columns (age group, service category,     visit type)

2️⃣ Data Loading & Transformation (SQL)

-Imported Excel sheets into SQL tables
-Designed relational schema
-Applied joins, window functions, CTEs
-Performed aggregations for department & doctor-wise metrics
-Created reusable SQL views for dashboards

3️⃣ Data Visualization (Power BI)

Developed an interactive, user-friendly dashboard displaying:

✔ Patient Admission Trends
✔ OPD vs IPD Summary
✔ Department Utilization
✔ Doctor Performance KPIs
✔ Billing & Revenue Analysis
✔ Daily, Monthly, Quarterly Insights

4️⃣ Insights & Recommendations

Some key insights (example):

-Cardiology department had the highest patient inflow
-Peak admissions occur between 10 AM – 2 PM
-Revenue increased by 18% YoY
-High patient no-show rate in outpatient appointments
